Different layout so there's more space for the soldier's inventory list
Hide shortcut when removing a soldier from squad in vanilla squad select
Replace IsWeaponAllowedByClass by IsWeaponAllowedByClass_CH

KNOWN ISSUES
When using vanilla squad select, the EQUIP LOADOUT shortcut will remain on screen even after the soldier is removed from that slot.
