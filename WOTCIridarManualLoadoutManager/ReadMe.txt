TODO: 

Saving as config
File autobackup

delete button too big, too left, and obscures text

figure out automatic list item size realization maybe
mod preview image
localization pass

squad loadout items list (conflate by weapon category configurable in MCM)

take num. utility slots into account when not equipping armor that grants the required extra slot

One day:
PCS support
Weapon Upgrade support
IAM integration
XSkin integration?
Use Tac Armory UI inventory images
Different layout so there's more space for the soldier's inventory list
Hide shortcut when removing a soldier from squad in vanilla squad select
Replace IsWeaponAllowedByClass by IsWeaponAllowedByClass_CH

KNOWN ISSUES
When using vanilla squad select, the EQUIP LOADOUT shortcut will remain on screen even after the soldier is removed from that slot.
